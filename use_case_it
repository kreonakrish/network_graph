This formatting uses:
- `#` for main headers
- `##` and `###` for subheaders
- `**` for bold text

When rendered on GitHub, the content will now have properly formatted bold text for emphasis. You can copy and paste this into your README file, and it should appear as expected. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
